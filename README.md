## 🔍 Description <a name="description"></a>
<p> Our application is made, so students can test their knowledge on different subjects. When you pick the test you want to take you will be welcomed by a few questions. Each question gives you a point. At the end of the test you can see how many points you have and the correct answer to the questions you have made a mistake on. </p>
